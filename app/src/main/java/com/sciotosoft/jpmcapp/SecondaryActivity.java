Text Dollar
Input
Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line contains a positive integer.

Output
For each set of input print a single line to standard output which is the english textual representation
of that integer. The output should be unspaced and in CamelCased. Always assume plural quantities.
You can also assume that the numbers are < 1000000000 (1 billion). In case of ambiguities eg. 2200
could be TwoThousandTwoHundredDollars or TwentyTwoHundredDollars, always choose the representation
with the larger base i.e. TwoThousandTwoHundredDollars.
